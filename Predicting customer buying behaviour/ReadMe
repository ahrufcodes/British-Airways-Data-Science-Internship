# Customer Booking ML Model

## Introduction
This repository contains the code for training and evaluating a machine learning model to predict customer bookings. The model utilizes a Random Forest algorithm and provides insights into the contribution of each variable to its predictive power.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:
2. Install the required libraries:
3. 
3. Prepare the dataset:
- Ensure that the customer booking dataset is available in the `data` directory.
- The dataset should be in CSV format and named `customer_booking.csv`.

4. Run the code:
- Open the `customer_booking_ml_model.py` file.
- Modify the file paths and names if necessary to match your environment.
- Execute the code to train and evaluate the model.

## Code Overview
The code in `customer_booking_ml_model.py` performs the following steps:

1. Import the required libraries and modules.
2. Read the customer booking dataset using pandas.
3. Preprocess the data:
- Convert categorical columns to one-hot encoding.
- Map the 'flight_day' column to numerical values.
- Split the dataset into input features (X) and the target variable (y).
4. Split the dataset into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function.
5. Train a Random Forest model on the training data.
6. Evaluate the model on the testing data and generate a classification report.
7. Calculate and print the feature importance and model parameters.
8. Generate visualizations to gain insights from the data:
- Histogram and boxplot for numerical variables.
- Bar plot for categorical variables.
- Pie chart for booking completion status.
- Correlation heatmap.
- Scatter plot and line plot for exploring relationships.

## Results
The model achieved a certain level of accuracy, as indicated by the classification report. The feature importance analysis provides insights into the variables contributing to the predictive power of the model. The visualizations offers a deeper understanding of the data and its relationships.


## Conclusion
The presented machine learning model provides a predictive solution for customer bookings. The code and visualizations offer valuable insights for decision-making and understanding the factors influencing bookings.
